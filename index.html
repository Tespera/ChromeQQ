<p>The inspiration of this project comes from my experience when using linux os. like other Chinese linux funs, there exists a troublesome and intolerable problem: QQ. Tencent hasn't updated "qq for linux" since 1.0 version, which is a test-like product with lots of bugs. It's easy to crash, Which is very annoying.</p>

<p>But linux funs always can find solutions, there have appeared some alternative stuff, like wine-qq, iqq, pidgin-lwqq, gtk-qq, qt-qq, pyqq ... so far. I have almost tested all of these, but can't find a perfect one. The most satified stuff I have ever used is wine-qq for international 2012 which is maked by Deepin Team, thank for their greate jobs. However, When I try to install it to my elementary OS, it doesn't work at all.</p>

<p>Maybe the reason why is Tencent not willing to improve qq for linux is some consideration of bussniss factors, or what Tencent considers is that make Linux users use their online qq pruduct: web qq, which is actually a open cloud platform which introduced many third-party content providers. it seems that Tencent has resolved the problem, but meanwhile web qq also has a little bad experience. Then maybe Tencent noticed this problem, so they continue to publishing smart qq, which is much more simply, function-single and fittable to mobile. But its experience is far behind QQ for windows and mac. It is so so. Actually, the most unhappy thing is I need to open the web brower when I want to use them!!</p>

<p>When google published chrome packaged app, I was deeply attracted by its cross-platform and native-like features. So I decided to make a app to integrate web qq and smart qq, with a very nice navigator easy to switch between them. and make them look like a native application. I always wish that my effort can remind Tencent about the bad experience when Linux users use its product!</p>
